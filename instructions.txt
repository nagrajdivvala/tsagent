Context:
You are an expert in chatbot architectures and platform migrations. We have two artifacts—botDefinition.js and botFunction.js—plus a config.json. I’m migrating this bot to a new platform.

Your Tasks:

High-Level Overview

Summarize the bot’s primary purpose and end-to-end conversation flow.

Identify key user journeys or “intents” supported by botDefinition.js.

botDefinition.js

Intents & Dialog Structure

Extract all intents, entities, slots, and dialog steps.

Map each dialog node: triggers, prompts, choices, and transitions.

REST API Calls & Transformations

For each fetch/axios/HTTP call:

Endpoint (from config.json or literal)

HTTP method and headers

Request payload structure and slot/context sources

Response handling: parsing, data mappings into bot variables

Error-handling or retry logic in-flow

Document any inline data transformations (e.g. date formatting, filtering).

Integration with botFunction.js

Identify every custom function invoked from bot scripts (e.g. calculateX(), formatY()).

Show where each helper is called and why.

botFunction.js

Function Catalog

List all exported functions: name, parameters, return type.

Describe each function’s purpose and inputs/outputs.

Usage Context

For each helper, point to its call sites in botDefinition.js.

Note any assumptions or dependencies (e.g. expects a userContext object).

config.json

Enumerate configuration keys: service URLs, credentials placeholders, timeouts, feature toggles.

Explain which keys drive API calls in botDefinition.js and which control behavior (e.g. locale, retry limits).

Conversation & State Management

Describe how context is stored and passed between turns (session variables, memory objects).

List any slot-filling, validation, and reprompt strategies in botDefinition.js.

Migration Plan

Dialog Mapping: For each intent/dialog, propose the equivalent construct in the target platform (flow, module, script).

API Mapping: For each HTTP call, outline the new platform’s connector/action, payload template, and variable mapping.

Helper Functions: Show how to re-implement or import each custom function.

Gap Analysis: Highlight any platform-specific features you’ll need to replace (custom code hooks, built-in validations).

Deliverable Format:

Use clear headings per section (Overview, botDefinition.js, botFunction.js, config.json, Migration Plan).

Within each section, use numbered lists or tables to map intents, API calls, and variables.

Include code snippets or JSON excerpts to illustrate each mapping.

End with a migration checklist summarizing all components to port over.





We’re migrating a chatbot implemented in three artifacts—botDefinition.js, botFunction.js, and config.json—to a new platform. The botDefinition.js file contains all dialog logic and REST calls, botFunction.js contains only custom helper functions, and config.json holds endpoint URLs and feature toggles.

Please perform the following tasks:

High-Level Overview

Summarize the bot’s core purpose and end-to-end conversation flow.

List the main user journeys or “intents” defined in botDefinition.js.

Dialog & API Extraction (botDefinition.js)

Intents & Dialog Structure: Extract every intent, entity, slot, and dialog node (triggers, prompts, transitions).

REST Calls: For each HTTP call in the script:

Endpoint (from config.json or literal) and HTTP method

Payload structure and source variables (slots/context)

Response parsing and mapping into bot variables

Inline data transformations (e.g., date formatting)

Error-handling logic (fallback messages, retries)

Helper Integration: Identify all calls to functions from botFunction.js (e.g. formatDate(), calculateScore()) and explain their role.

Helper Functions (botFunction.js)

List every exported function with its signature and describe its purpose.

Point to each invocation in botDefinition.js and note expected inputs/outputs.

Configuration (config.json)

Enumerate all configuration keys (service URLs, credentials placeholders, timeouts, toggles).

Explain how each key influences API calls and dialog behavior.

State Management & Validation

Describe how the bot tracks session state or context across turns.

Document any slot-filling, validation, and reprompt strategies.

Migration Blueprint

Dialog Mapping: For each intent, propose the equivalent construct in the target platform (flow/module/script).

API Mapping: For each REST call, outline the new platform’s connector/action, payload templates, and variable mappings.

Helpers: Recommend how to re-implement or import each custom function.

Gap Analysis: Highlight any features or behaviors that need special handling in the new platform.

Deliverable Format:

Use headings for each section (Overview, Dialog & APIs, Helpers, Config, State, Migration Blueprint).

Use numbered lists or tables to map intents, API calls, variables, and functions.

Include code snippets or JSON excerpts for clarity.

Finish with a migration checklist summarizing all components to port.
